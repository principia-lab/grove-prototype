# Grove Prototype Lab Note

**Project:** Grove â€” AI-collaborative scientific discovery  
**Date:** 2025-09-24  
**Focus:** Screening materials for superconductors, semiconductors, batteries, and catalysts.

## Objective
Accelerate discovery by using AI as a partner in hypothesis generation, screening, and ranking.

## Method (synthetic demo)
- Generated 50 synthetic candidate materials with plausible properties.  
- Computed heuristic scores (stability, manufacturability).  
- Derived an AI-driven `success_probability`.  
- Ranked candidates and visualized top-10.

## Results
- Dataset: [grove_materials_dataset.csv](grove_materials_dataset.csv)  
- Top-10 chart: see homepage

## Next Steps
- Validate top candidates with real simulations/experiments.  
- Refine AI model using new data.
